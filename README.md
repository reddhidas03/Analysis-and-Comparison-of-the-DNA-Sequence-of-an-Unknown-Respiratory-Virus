This repository contains the required Python codes used to generate the figures in the paper “Analysis and Comparison of the DNA Sequence of an Unknown Respiratory Virus with Influenza and Corona Using Biopython”.

This folder contains three .py files:
1.	temp1.py was used for DNA sequencing of the unknown virus. It computes the DNA nucleotides G, A, T, C, and GC% of the unknown virus. This code was repeated for the DNA sequencing of influenza and corona.
2.	temp2.py calculates the amino acid length and the total functional protein counts of the unknown virus. It was repeated for influenza and coronavirus as well.
3.	temp3.py computes the similarity percentage of the unknown virus to both influenza and coronavirus. Then it plots the necessary data to generate the output graph figures of this paper.
